Hello! I'm Jamikal (pronounced like juh-michael) and I'm all about Cloud Engineering and DevOps technology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a little bit of everything, but I really like Golang and Infrastructure as Code, and automating as many things as possible.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://medium.com/@jamikal.hall) and see what I've been learning on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jamikal.hall).
