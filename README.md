Hello! I'm Jamikal (pronounced like juh-michael) and I'm all about Cloud Engineering and DevOps technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of everything, but I really like Golang and Infrastructure as Code, and automating as many things as possible.
- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamikal-hall/)) and follow my journey on [Medium]([url](https://medium.com/@jamikal.hall))
